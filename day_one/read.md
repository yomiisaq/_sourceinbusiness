hello everyone, welcome to SourceInBusiness, where digital growth in youth is our priority. my name is Chime Chibuike princewill, I am a FullStack Engineer at Descasio ltd, Lagos, MernStack developer at DevInclusive, Fullstack facilitator at CoveIT world.
Once again I said welcome to everyone, without wasting more time, I would want you guys to let me know which site/web page you interact with every day. I will give you guys two-minute to drop that in the comment section.

All right, from what I see, I will say that most of us interact with one webpage or the other. That's means we all love what happens on the web.

If you are hearing me, I want to say a big congratulation for starting up a career in web development, trust me, it's a step you won't have a regret.

let's start with knowing what web development is all about: it is the building and maintaining of a website. It deals more with the things that happen behind the scene to make a website look great, fast and have a good user experience.

we wouldn't have discussed web development without knowing who builds and maintains this website. The people that build this website and maintain them are referred to as web developers.

Web developer uses some tools in other to add content into the browser and design these contents,
there are a lot of these tools but let's take a lot at the two primary tools

- Html - Hypertext markup language
- CSS - Cascading style sheet

still around I will discuss these tools before the end of this course.

meanwhile, I would want to know why you choose to be a web developer. find a book and a pen to pen it down.

Why be a web developer:

- Cet a Job
- Competitive salary
- Remote work
- Degree exception

\*\*\* Introduction to Html: Html stands for hypertext markup language, It is a markup language used for adding content into the browser or web. Today HTML has improved from HTML to html5.

This is a tool used to add content to the browser. It is a standard defined by the WHATWG- web hypertext application technology working group. Is an organization formed by people working on the most popular web browser, it is controlled by Google, Mozilla, Apple and Microsoft. Html was invented in the year 1993 and since then it has evolved from HTML to html5

\*\*\* syntax: When writing our markups, there are ways and patterns I will have to follow so that the browser can recognize them. These markups are called tags.

We have:
an opening tag and closing tag,
and self-closing tags

<> </>

<Opening tags>: These are tags that begins an element while the closing tags are tag that end an element.

<self closing tags/> are tags that does not have wrap an element.

This leads us to what is called Element: are tags that have contents inbetween them, we have two type of elements:
block element and inline element:
block element are element that does not allow any other element beside them while inline is the opposite

shortly we will all see how I am going to implement it.

<Html structure>: While trying to add up content into the browser, we have to follow an appropriate structure so that the browser will recognize the mark up we have written. Firstly, I have to let the browser know of the version of html i am using. secondly, I will let the browser know the type of document i am writing, in my case, Its html.

html tag is an opening and closing tag that will wrap all other tags

<html></html>

<head></head>: These is where you add the browser data; like links, meta, scripts, styles and so on.

<body></body>: The is where all the content I want to display on the browser goes.

tags: <heading><p><i><em><strong><mark><b><l><sup><sub><ins><del> <q><progress>
